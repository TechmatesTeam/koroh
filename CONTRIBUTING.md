# Contributing to Koroh Platform

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Koroh! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Project Overview

Koroh is an AI-powered professional networking platform that helps users build meaningful professional connections through intelligent matching and personalized recommendations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TechmatesTeam/koroh
   cd koroh
   ```

3. Set up the development environment:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   make dev
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - Critical fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:

```
feat(api): add user profile endpoints
fix(web): resolve login form validation issue
docs: update API documentation
```

### Code Style

#### Python (Django Backend)

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters

#### JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js Frontend)

- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript for new code

### Testing

#### Backend Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
docker-compose exec api python manage.py test apps.users.tests.test_models

# Run with coverage
docker-compose exec api coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
docker-compose exec api coverage report
```

#### Frontend Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose exec web npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
docker-compose exec web npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
docker-compose exec web npm run test:coverage
```

### Database Migrations

When making model changes:

1. Create migrations:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec api python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

2. Apply migrations:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec api python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Include migration files in your commit
